<H1>Monitor for Santa, His Reindeer, and His Elves</H1>

<!--
Next time, say there are 20 reindeer of which 9 must trickle out of
the barn and be hitched to the sleigh for Santa to deliver presents.
This is more realistic.  Also means when Santa returns from delivering
there may be 9 fresh reindeer AND 3 elves waiting.
Because of barging, it is possible even with just 9 reindeer, for Santa
to unblock from a wait() and see 9 ready reindeer and 3 problem-plagued
elves: the 3rd elve may do notify() and 9th reindeer barge into monitor
before Santa.

<P>
In this simulation, there is one Santa Claus thread, 20 reindeer threads,
and 11 elf threads.
In the beginning, the reindeer threads are in the barn
and the elf threads are in the toy factory.
Santa Claus waits in his shop up at the North Pole, and can only
be unblocked by either
<UL>
<LI> nine of the 20 reindeer showing up at Santa's shop from the barn
     ready to deliver presents, or
<LI> some group of three elves who are having difficulties
     assemblying their toys and come to Santa in his shop for help.
</UL>
When nine reindeer show up, Santa and his reindeer deliver
presents (simulated with a <TT>nap()</TT>) around the world for a while.
When three elves are having their problems solved by Santa in his
shop, any other elf wishing to visit Santa's shop for help must wait
outside the shop entrance
(a) for the three elves currently in the shop to exit the shop,
and (b) for two other elves to form a group of three to enter the shop
together for help.
If Santa awakens to see three elves in his shop for help and
nine reindeer showing up, the reindeer get priority.
When Santa and his reindeer return from delivering presents,
the reindeer return to the heated barn and munch food and warm up
(simulated with a <TT>nap()</TT>) for a while.
Santa helps three elves solve toy assembly problems with a <TT>nap()</TT>.
Elves work individually assemblying a toy in the factory with a <TT>nap()</TT>.
Each elf periodically needs Santa's help at random times assemblying a toy.

<P>
As in all our programming assignments, use command line arguments
to set the simulation parameters.
</P>

<P>
Remember that Java monitors are `signal and continue' so be sure
to think about the ramifications of this as you design your monitor,
in particular ``barging''.
No semaphores and no busy waiting allowed.
Do not use <TT>nap()</TT> within a synchronized monitor method.
</P>

<P>
For the purposes of this assignment you may assume that each <TT>notify()</TT>
awakens the thread that has been waiting the longest.
But it is unpredictable when that thread will get back into the monitor.
It is possible for other threads that have called a monitor synchronized
method to ``barge'' in ahead of it.
Also, <TT>notifyAll()</TT> awakens all the waiting threads and it is
unpredictable which thread will get back into the monitor first
and whether another thread will ``barge'' in ahead of it.
</P>

<P>
Here is one way to approach a monitor programming assignment.
Think of the monitor as maintaining the state of the system
in integer and boolean data fields and the synchronized methods
as making atomic changes to the state of the system.
If a thread enters the monitor and needs a resource that is currently
unavailable or needs to synchronize with another thread, then
<PRE>
while (<I>condition</I>) wait();
</PRE>
Any time a thread changes a variable that may affect the
<TT><I>condition</I></TT> some other thread is waiting on,
do a <TT>notifyAll()</TT> before exiting the method.
</P>

<P>
Animate your program using
<A HREF="../lib/XtangoAnimation/XtangoAnimator.java">
<TT>XtangoAnimator.java</TT></A>.
First do the base assignment as specified above and turn it in.
Then do an animation of it as a separate program.
