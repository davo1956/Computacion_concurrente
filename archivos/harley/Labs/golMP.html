<H1>Game of Life Simulation Using Message Passing</H1>

<P>
Write a multi-class parallel Java program
that simulates the <EM>game of life</EM>.
Each cell will have its own thread dedicated to it
to compute the cell's value in the next generation.
This thread will be embedded in a class that is instantiated
M*N times by the driver, once for each cell in the grid.
Thread synchronization will be done with message passing.
</P>

<P>
No semaphores, no monitors, and no busy waiting allowed!
Neither <TT>nap()</TT> nor <TT>sleep()</TT> is allowed.
</P>

<P>
The primary problem you have to solve is coordinating all the cell
threads during each generation.
A cell thread cannot start computing the new cell value for the
next generation until all other cells have
completed the computation for the current generation.
Use Java message passing, that is <TT>send</TT>
and <TT>receive</TT> to solve this problem.
</P>

<P>
If you have not already done so for game-of-life,
animate your program using
<A HREF="../sequential.html#ALGAN">
<TT>XtangoAnimator</TT></A>.
