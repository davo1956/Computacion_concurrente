<H1>Multiple-Person Bumper Car Ride Monitor</H1>

<P>
This is Exercise 5.14 in the text.
Remember that Java monitors are `signal and continue' so be sure
to think about the ramifications of this as you design your monitor.
</P>

<P>
No semaphores and no busy waiting allowed!
Do not use <CODE>nap()</CODE> within a monitor <TT>synchronized</TT> method.
Do you see why?
Only three <TT>nap()</TT>'s are allowed in this program:
riders wandering, cars bumping, and one in <TT>main()</TT> to shutdown
the simulation.
</P>

<P>
If you have not already done so,
animate your program using
<A HREF="../lib/XtangoAnimation/XtangoAnimator.java">
<TT>XtangoAnimator.java</TT></A>.
