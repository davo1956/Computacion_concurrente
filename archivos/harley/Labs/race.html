<P>
This is a modification of Exercise 2
at the end of Chapter 3 of the text.
Run <A HREF="../Threads/race.java"><TT>race.java</TT></A>
and verify that there are no race conditions for
<TT>M=1000</TT>.
Explain why you think this is true.
Introduce time-slicing with a
<A HREF="../lib/Utilities/Scheduler.java"><TT>Scheduler</TT></A>
object.
Experimentally determine the largest time-slice value passed to the
<TT>Scheduler</TT> object's constructor that will consistently cause
incorrect output due to a race condition for <TT>M=1000</TT>.
Report and explain your findings.
</P>

<P>
Next, start with a fixed time-slice of 10 milliseconds
using the <TT>Scheduler</TT>
and find the smallest value of <TT>M</TT>
that will consistently cause
incorrect output due to a race condition.
Report and explain your findings.
</P>

<P>
Finally, answer
Exercise 5 at the end of Chapter 3 of the text:
Identify the race condition(s) that could occur in
<A HREF="../Threads/bwbb.java">Class 3.8</A>
if there were more than one producer thread and/or consumer thread.
