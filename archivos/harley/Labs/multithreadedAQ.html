<H1>Multithreaded Adaptive Quadrature</H1>

<P>
Remember how this algorithm works.
We approximate the area under the curve with a trapezoid.
Then we decide whether or not to accept this approximation
by calculating the areas of the two smaller trapezoids
formed using the midpoint.
If their sum is close enough to the original trapezoid,
we accept the original trapezoid as an approximation to
the area under the curve.
If the sum is not close enough, then we take each of the
two smaller trapezoids and apply the above algorithm recursively
to each.
Start a new thread each time the algorithm is called recursively.
See the skeleton code below.

<H2>Input Data</H2>

<P>
The input data consists of three <TT>double</TT> numbers:
<I>a</I>, <I>b</I>, and <I>epsilon</I>.
The function to integrate is defined in a separate class.
You may parse these three numbers from the command line
or read them from the keyboard or a file.
</P>

<P>
Try your program on these functions (<I>epsilon</I> of 0.0001):
<I>sin(x)</I> from 0.1 to 1.0,
<I>tan(x)</I> from 0.1 to 1.0,
<I>x**2</I> from 0.1 to 1.0,
<I>sqrt(x)</I> from 0.1 to 1.0,
and
<I>-log(x)</I> from 0.1 to 1.0 (note this is the negative of the logrithm).
<B>Include these examples</B> in your submitted sample output.
</P>

<P>
This algorithm coded in Java might not work well from 0.0 to <I>b</I>
on some functions whose value at 0.0 is 0.0,
so that is why 0.1 is used above.
Since this is just a warm-up exercise and not a numerical methods class,
we will not worry about this.
