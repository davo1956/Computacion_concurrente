<H1>Printing W, X, Y, and Z</H1>

<P>
<A HREF="../Semaphores/ABCs.java">Program 4.3</A>
uses semaphores to synchronize three threads
so they print out the letters `A', `B', and `C' according to certain rules.
Your task in this programming assignment is to synchronize four threads
so they print out the letters `W', `X', `Y', and `Z'
according to the following rules.
<OL>
<LI> The total number of `W's and `X's that have been output at any point
     in the output string cannot exceed the total number of `Y's and `Z's
     that have been output at that point.
<LI> The total number of `W's that have been output at any point in the
     output string cannot exceed twice the number of `X's that have been
     output at that point.
<LI> After a `Y' has been output, another `Y' cannot be output until one
     or more `Z's have been output.
</OL>
</P>

<P>
Use a single monitor object instantiated from a class <TT>Control</TT>
for synchronization.
<B>Do not mechanically translate semaphore code into monitor code!</B>
Each of the four printing threads invokes a <TT>synchronized</TT>
monitor method for its synchronization.
No semaphores allowed.
No <TT>synchronized</TT> blocks allowed,
only <TT>synchronized</TT> methods.
No busy waiting allowed.
No calls to <TT>nap</TT> inside a <TT>synchronized</TT> method allowed
(do not nap while holding the monitor object's lock, that is, while inside
a synchronized method or while inside a method called by a synchronized
method).
Do you see why?
</P>

<H2>Input Data</H2>

<P>
The input data consists of five integer (<TT>int</TT>) numbers:
<I>w</I>, <I>x</I>, <I>y</I>, <I>z</I>, and <I>runtime</I>.
You <B>must</B> parse these five numbers from the command line
using the <TT>GetOpt</TT> class
(<A HREF="../lib/Utilities/GetOpt.java">Library Class 2.1</A>).
The command line has the form
<OL>
<TT>% java WXYZs -w </TT><I>w</I><TT> -x </TT><I>x</I><TT> -y </TT><I>y</I><TT> -z </TT><I>z</I><TT> -R </TT><I>runtime</I>
</OL>
Remember to give the corresponding variables default values in your
program to handle missing command line options.
</P>

<P>
The numbers <I>w</I>, <I>x</I>, <I>y</I>, and <I>z</I>
control the napping time of the four threads printing the corresponding
letter, as follows.
<PRE>
class Pw extends ... implements Runnable {
   public void run () {
      while (true) {
         int napping = 1+(int)random(1000*w); // w is in seconds
         nap(napping);

         ...    // synchronization to follow the rules

         System.out.print("W"); System.out.flush();

         ...    // synchronization to follow the rules
      }
   }
}
</PRE>
Before each time a thread prints a letter (according to the rules),
it naps for a random number of milliseconds generated from
its command line argument (in seconds) or its default value.
The number <I>runtime</I> controls how long the whole program runs,
i.e., there is a <TT>nap(1000*runtime)</TT> in the <TT>main</TT>
method.
