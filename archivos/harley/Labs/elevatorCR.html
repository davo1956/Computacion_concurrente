<H1>The Elevator Problem --- Again!</H1>

<P>
Your assignment is to write a multi-class multithreaded Java program
that simulates the movement of the people in the building and their use
of the elevator.
In addition to the people and elevator classes, there is a
<TT>ControlPanel</TT> class from which is instantiated
a control panel object containing a control panel thread.
Use <I>conditional rendezvous</I> to synchronize the elevator thread,
the control panel thread, and the people threads.
See the following library classes and example programs.
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="../lib/Synchronization/RendezvousCondition.java">Library Class 6.19: Rendezvous Condition.</A>
<LI><A HREF="../lib/Synchronization/ConditionalRendezvous.java">Library Class 6.20: Conditional Rendezvous.</A>
<LI><A HREF="../Rendezvous/dpre.java">Program 6.10: Dining Philosophers Using Conditional Rendezvous.</A>
<LI><A HREF="../Rendezvous/bnkr.java">Program 6.11: Bank Deposits and Withdrawals.</A>
</UL>
No semaphores are allowed, the keyword <TT>synchronized</TT> cannot be
used, and no busy waiting is allowed.
</P>

<P>
The program operates in two modes, a random mode and a deterministic mode.
The way the elevator operates is as before.
One place to start is with the distributed dining philosophers,
<A HREF="../Messaging/ddph.java">Program 6.6</A>.
This program uses conditional message passing, however.
</P>

<P>
Your program will have an elevator class from which an elevator object
containing the elevator thread is instantiated,
a control panel class from which a control panel object
containing the control panel thread is instantiated,
and a person class from which person objects containing a person thread each
are instantiated.

         cr.clientTransactServer(new CallButton(id, onFloor));
         cr.clientTransactServer(new ToButton(id, onFloor, toFloor));

         Object request = r.serverGetRequest();
         if (request instanceof ElevatorRequest) {
            ...
         } else if (request instanceof CallButton {
            int floor = ((CallButton) request).getFloor();
            int id = ((CallButton) request).getID();
            controlPanel[id][floor] = r;  // save for a later reply
            ...

<H2>Input Data</H2>

<P>
Everybody must include the following two deterministic examples in their
submitted sample runs.
<PRE>
% java Elevator -p 1 -f 11 -R 40 -D
3 2 5 11 5 1 5
% java Elevator -p 5 -f 11 -R 360 -D
10  2  1 11  1  1  5  2  1  3  1  4  1  5  1  6  1  7  1  1 99
10  4  1 11  2  1  5  3  1  4  1  5  1  6  1  7  1  8  1  1 99
10  6  1 11  3  1  5  4  1  5  1  6  1  7  1  8  1  9  1  1 99
10  8  1 11  4  1  5  5  1  6  1  7  1  8  1  9  1 10  1  1 99
10 10  1 11  5  1  5  6  1  7  1  8  1  9  1 10  1 11  1  1 99
</PRE>
</P>

<P>
Be sure to (stress) test your program with the following kinds of input data.
<UL>
<LI> One person in the building who wanders (naps) for a long time on each
     floor (so the elevator goes into its idle state).
<LI> Many people wandering for short periods of time, keeping the elevator
     busy.
</UL>
</P>

<H2>For Extra Credit</H2>

<P>
The building has <I>N<sub>elevators</sub></I> elevators.
Each floor has a single call button shared by all the elevators.
When an elevator stops on a floor, it picks up all people waiting
on that floor.
