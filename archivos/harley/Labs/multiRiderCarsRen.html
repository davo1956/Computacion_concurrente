<H1>Multiple-Person Bumper Car Ride: Rendezvous</H1>

<P>
Modify your multiple-person bumper car program so that
the coordinator class no longer uses semaphores but uses the
<I>rendezvous</I> concept instead.
Eliminate the restriction that at most two cars can be on the
bumping floor at any one time, that is,
as many cars as are full of riders and ready to bump can enter the floor.
</P>

<P>
Your coordinator class will have the interface routines
<PRE>
getInLine(ID)
waitCarFull(ID)
takeAride(ID)
load(ID)
unload(ID)
</PRE>
called by the riders and cars.
</P>

<P>
The bumper car is a separate class that is created multiple times.
Ditto the rider class.
</P>

<P>
The coordinator object will create an <TT>EstablishRendezvous</TT>
object (local case) that the rider and car threads will call indirectly
through the coordinator interface methods mentioned above.
When a rider calls <TT>getInLine()</TT>, the coordinator will
call the <TT>EstablishRendezvous</TT> method <TT>clientToServer()</TT>,
which returns an <TT>ExtendedRendezvous</TT> object.
When a rider calls <TT>waitCarFull()</TT>, the coordinator will
call the <TT>ExtendedRendezvous</TT> method
<TT>clientMakeRequestAwaitReply()</TT>.
When a rider calls <TT>takeAride()</TT>, the coordinator will
again call the <TT>ExtendedRendezvous</TT> method
<TT>clientMakeRequestAwaitReply()</TT>.
</P>

<P>
When a car thread calls <TT>load()</TT>, the coordinator will call the
<TT>serverToClient()</TT> method of the <TT>EstablishRendezvous</TT>
object, which will return an <TT>ExtendedRendezvous</TT> object,
as many times as the car has room for riders.
Each of these <TT>ExtendedRendezvous</TT> objects will be ``connected''
to a rider thread.
Think carefully about whether or not multiple cars should
be allowed to load at the same time.
When the car is full, each <TT>ExtendedRendezvous</TT> object will
have its <TT>serverGetRequest()</TT> and <TT>serverMakeReply()</TT>
methods called.
When the car's ride is over, each <TT>ExtendedRendezvous</TT> object will
have its <TT>serverGetRequest()</TT> and <TT>serverMakeReply()</TT>
methods called again.
This will complete two rendezvous with the rider threads:
<TT>waitCarFull()</TT> and <TT>takeAride()</TT>.
</P>

<P>
No semaphores and no busy waiting allowed!
Only three <TT>nap()</TT>'s are allowed in this program:
riders wandering, cars bumping, and one in <TT>main()</TT> to shutdown
the simulation.
