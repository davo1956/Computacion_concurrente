<H1>The Elevator Problem</H1>

<P>
In a medium-sized city somewhere in Pennsylvania stands a building with
<I>N<sub>floors</sub></I> floors, numbered from one on up, and an elevator.
The <I>N<sub>people</sub></I> people who work in the building
use the elevator to move from one floor to another.
At exactly 8 o'clock every weekday morning, these people enter the building
and take the elevator to the floors they work on.
The elevator is waiting with open doors at 8 o'clock and is big enough
to hold all <I>N<sub>people</sub></I> at once.
From 8 o'clock in the morning until 5 o'clock in the afternoon,
the people wander around the building,
using the elevator to move from floor to floor as needed.
</P>

<P>
Your assignment is to write a multi-class multithreaded Java program
that simulates the movement of the people in the building and their use
of the elevator.
Use semaphores to synchronize the elevator thread and the people
threads.
</P>

<P>
The program operates in two modes, a random mode and a deterministic mode.
In the random mode, a command line argument is used to compute random
floor wandering times of the people.
<PRE>
int wander = 1 + (int) random(1000*maxWander);
nap(wander);
</PRE>
After wandering around on a particular floor,
each person generates a different random floor number and then uses the elevator
to go to that floor and wander around for another random amount of time.
</P>

<P>
In the deterministic mode,
each person operates according to an input script,
which determines which floor the person goes to and how long the
person wanders around on that floor before using the elevator to go
to another floor.
</P>

<P>
When a person wants to use the elevator to go to another floor,
the person pushes the elevator call button,
waits for the elevator to arrive and open its doors,
enters the elevator, pushes the button of the destination floor,
and waits for the elevator to arrive at that floor.
Because this is an old building, each floor has just a single button
to call the elevator, not separate ``up'' and ``down'' buttons
we are more accustomed to seeing.
</P>

<P>
The elevator continually goes up and down,
picking up and dropping off passengers.
After unloading, the elevator waits where it is if there are no waiting
passengers on other floors;
if there are people waiting, the elevator picks them up.
</P>

<P>
What algorithm does the elevator use when on floor <I>f</I> and
there are people waiting on floors <I>x</I>, <I>y</I>, ..., and <I>z</I>?
The elevator does not use ``nearest floor next'' because that could leave
people on the upper or lower floors waiting longer than is fair.
Instead,
the elevator goes up until it reaches the highest floor needed to pick up
or drop off a passenger and then goes down to the lowest floor needed to
pick up or drop off a passenger.
While going up and down like this,
the elevator picks up and drops off passengers along the way.
The important feature of the elevator algorithm is that the elevator does
not reverse direction until it has gone as far in one direction as
needed to pick up and/or drop off passengers.
This should sound familiar to those acquainted with disk arm
scheduling algorithms.
</P>

<P>
The elevator takes one second to move from a floor to the next higher or
lower floor.
If the elevator needs to stop at a particular floor to pick up or
discharge passengers, it takes at least one second to do so.
After a person disembarks, that person cannot board the elevator again
until the elevator leaves and returns to that person's floor
<B>unless</B> the elevator is idle (no call buttons pushed and no
floor buttons pushed) right after that person disembarks.
</P>

<P>
Your program will have an elevator class from which an elevator object
containing the elevator thread is instantiated,
and a person class from which person objects containing a person thread each
are instantiated.
In either the elevator class or another coordinator class,
place all the semaphores and other state variables as private data fields.
The <TT>main</TT> method in a driver class starts everything going.
A person object calls a method in the elevator object to indicate the
person is waiting on a floor to be picked up.
The person thread blocks on a semaphore inside the method until picked
up by the elevator.
When picked up, the person object calls another method to indicate the
desired destination floor.
The person thread blocks on a semaphore inside the method until the
elevator arrives at the floor.
When arriving at a floor, the elevator thread naps for one second to let
passengers get on and off, then the elevator thread blocks until
all passengers have safely (dis)embarked.
<PRE>
class Person ... {
   ...
   public void run() {  // person thread
      ...
      while (true) {
         int wander = 1 + (int) random(1000*maxWander);
         nap(wander);
         int toFloor = (int) random(...);
         elevator.callButton(onFloor);
         elevator.toButton(toFloor);
      }
   }
}

<P>
How to get started on your design of this mess?
The <A HREF="../Semaphores/slba.java">sleeping barber</A>
program is an excellent one on which to base your design.
Note the similarities: customers interact with the barber for service,
passengers interact with the elevator for service.
</P>

<H2>Input Data</H2>

<P>
The input data to your Java program are the number of people in the
building, the maximum person building wander time (napping time),
the number of floors in the building,
the simulation running time, and a flag for deterministic mode.
Place these numbers on the command line for your program to parse.
You <B>must</B> parse these numbers from the command line
with the <TT>GetOpt</TT> class
(<A HREF="../lib/Utilities/GetOpt.java">Library Class 2.1</A>).
The command line has the form
<OL>
<TT>% java Elevator -p </TT><I>N<sub>people</sub></I><TT> -w </TT><I>maxWander</I><TT> -f </TT><I>N<sub>floors</sub></I><TT> -R </TT><I>runTime</I><TT> -D </TT>
</OL>
Remember to give the corresponding variables default values in your
program to handle missing command line options.
</P>

<P>
If the <TT>-D</TT> command line argument is present,
the program operates in deterministic mode.
In this mode,
the program reads from the keyboard
information for the people to control their activities
(to read from a file, input can be redirected in this way:
<TT>java</TT> <TT>Program</TT>
<I>command line arguments</I> <TT>&lt;</TT><I>file</I>).
See <A HREF="../Sequential/tokn.java">
``Program/Class 2.5: Reading Keyboard Input''</A>
for an example of how to read multiple numbers per line.
For each person, one or more lines of the form
<PRE>
<I>n</I> <I>f<sub>1</sub></I> <I>t<sub>1</sub></I> <I>f<sub>2</sub></I> <I>t<sub>2</sub></I> <I>f<sub>3</sub></I> <I>t<sub>3</sub></I> ... <I>f<sub>n</sub></I> <I>t<sub>n</sub></I>
</PRE>
are present.
Here, <TT><I>n</I></TT> is the number of elevator ride/floor wandering pairs
for the person and the pair
<TT><I>f<sub>i</sub></I></TT> <TT><I>t<sub>i</sub></I></TT>
means the person takes the elevator to floor <TT><I>f<sub>i</sub></I></TT>
and wanders around on that floor for exactly
<TT><I>t<sub>i</sub></I></TT> seconds before using the elevator to go to
another floor.
</P>

<P>
<B>Everybody</B> must include the following two deterministic examples in their
submitted sample runs.
<PRE>
% java Elevator -p 1 -f 11 -R 40 -D
3 2 5 11 5 1 5
% java Elevator -p 5 -f 11 -R 360 -D
10  2  1 11  1  1  5  2  1  3  1  4  1  5  1  6  1  7  1  1 99
10  4  1 11  2  1  5  3  1  4  1  5  1  6  1  7  1  8  1  1 99
10  6  1 11  3  1  5  4  1  5  1  6  1  7  1  8  1  9  1  1 99
10  8  1 11  4  1  5  5  1  6  1  7  1  8  1  9  1 10  1  1 99
10 10  1 11  5  1  5  6  1  7  1  8  1  9  1 10  1 11  1  1 99
</PRE>
</P>

<P>
Be sure to (stress) test your program with the following kinds of input data.
<UL>
<LI> One person in the building who wanders (naps) for a long time on each
     floor (so the elevator goes into its idle state).
<LI> Many people wandering for short periods of time, keeping the elevator
     busy.
</UL>
