<H1>Multiple-Person Bumper Car Ride: RMI</H1>

<P>
Modify your multiple-person bumper car program so that
the coordinator class is registered (<TT>rmiregistry</TT>)
on <TT>jubjub</TT> and called remotely from <TT>cheshire</TT> by the
car threads and from <TT>queen</TT> by the rider threads.
Eliminate the restriction that at most two cars can be on the
bumping floor at any one time, that is,
as many cars as are full of riders and ready to bump can enter the floor.
Your coordinator can use whatever you want except for busy-waiting
for its internal synchronization.
</P>

<P>
Your coordinator class will have the interface routines
<PRE>
getInLine(ID)
waitCarFull(ID)
takeAride(ID)
load(ID)
unload(ID)
</PRE>
called by the riders and cars.
The bumper car is a separate class that is created multiple times.
Ditto the rider class.
</P>

<P>
You will have to run your owm <TT>rmiregistry</TT> on a port
number between 1024 and 65535 that you pick at random that nobody else
in the class is using.
Here is how to run the
<A HREF="../RMI/Compute.java">example</A>
we looked at in class with 7777 picked as the random port,
the server on <TT>jubjub</TT> and the client on <TT>cheshire</TT>.

<P>
You <B>MUST</B> clean up after yourself each time you logout!
Points will be taken off for any <TT>rmiregistry</TT>s
or any <TT>Coordinator</TT> servers that are left running on any machines.
Use the <TT>ps</TT> command to see what you have running in the background
and the <TT>kill</TT> command to get rid of processes before logging out.
There are two versions of the command.
Here are example uses of each version of <TT>ps</TT>
and the <TT>kill</TT> command.
Of course, replace <TT>janedoe</TT> with your login id.
