<H1>Game of Life Simulation Using Multiple Threads</H1>

<P>
Write a multi-class multi-threaded Java program
that simulates the <EM>game of life</EM>.
Each cell will have its own thread dedicated to it
to compute the cell's value in the next generation.
This thread will be embedded in a class that is instantiated
M*N times by the driver, once for each cell in the grid.
Thread synchronization will be done with semaphores.
</P>

<P>
The primary problem you have to solve is coordinating all the cell
threads during each generation.
A cell thread cannot start computing the new cell value for the
next generation until all other cells have
completed their computation for the current generation.
Use Java semaphores, that is <TT>P(S)</TT>
and <TT>V(S)</TT> to solve this problem.
</P>

<P>
Have a look at a
<A HREF="../lib/Synchronization/Barrier.java">
<I>barrier</I></A>.
You will find it extremely useful!
Here is an
<A HREF="../Parallel/grba.java">example</A>
program using a barrier.
</P>

<P>
For those needing help with creating a thread for each cell in the grid,
have a look at <A HREF="golWRONG.java">this</A> <B>incorrect</B> solution.
Make sure you see why it is wrong.
</P>

<P>
Neither <TT>nap()</TT> nor <TT>sleep()</TT> is allowed.
</P>

<P>
If you have not already done so for game-of-life,
animate your program using
<A HREF="../sequential.html#ALGAN">
<TT>XtangoAnimator</TT></A>.
