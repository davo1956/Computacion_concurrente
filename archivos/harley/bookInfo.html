<H2>Principal Purpose of the Book</H2>

<P>
To give software professionals and
operating systems and concurrent programming students experience
writing concurrent programs in Java, a well-known programming language.
This will reinforce and increase their knowledge of semaphores, monitors,
message passing, remote procedure calls, and the rendezvous as tools
for concurrent thread synchronization and communication.
</P>

<H2>Detailed Description of the Book</H2>

<P>
The abundance of hype Java receives should not distract us from the
fact that it has many excellent features for sequential
programming: object-oriented, no explicit pointers and no pointer
arithmetic, automatic garbage collection and no memory leaks, strong
typing, platform independence, and many compiler and run-time checks.
The Java development kit comes with a rich collection
of class libraries for data structures, IO, networking, remote
procedure calls, and graphics.  Since threads are built-in, Java can be
used for concurrent programming and developing multithreaded applications.
In particular, it can be used by instructors as the concurrency platform
in operating systems and related courses to give students practice and
experience in concurrent programming.
</P>

<P>
Designed for students and professional programmers, this books covers
multithreading issues such as race conditions, critical sections, mutual
exclusion, and condition synchronization.  Java programs that use semaphores
and monitors are shown as examples.  Next, the book describes several thread
communication tools: message passing, the rendezvous, and remote procedure
calls, also illustrated with Java examples.  These tools are used extensively
in client-server programming.  An algorithm animation package, written in
Java, is used in several of the example programs.  The book concludes with
a brief introduction to parallel processing with Java
in a shared-memory multiprocessor or a distributed memory
cluster environment.
