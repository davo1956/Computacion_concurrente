<A NAME="MESSA"><H2>Message Passing</H2>

<P>
Sometimes the phrase ``send a message to an object'' is used to
describe a thread in one object calling a method in another object.
Here, that phrase is used to describe a thread in one object
sending a message to a thread in another object, where the message
is itself an object.
</P>

<P>
This technique is used for thread communication and synchronization
in a computing environment where the threads do not have shared memory
(since the threads reside in different virtual or physical machines).
Hence the threads cannot share semaphores or monitors and cannot
use shared variables to communicate.
Message passing can still be used, of course, in a shared memory platform.
</P>

<P>
Messages are sent through a port or channel with an operation like
<I>send(channel, message)</I> and received from a port or channel
with an operation like <I>receive(channel, message)</I>.
Messages can be passed <I>synchronously</I>, meaning the sender
blocks until the received does a receive and the receiver blocks
until the sender does a send.
Since the sender and receiver are at specific known points in their
code at a known specific instant of time, synchronous message passing
is also called a <I>simple rendezvous</I> with a one-way flow of
information from the sender to the receiver.
</P>

<P>
In <I>asynchronous</I> message passing, the sender does not block.
If there is not a receiver waiting to receive the message, the message
is queued or buffered.
The receiver still blocks if there is no queued or buffered message
when a receive is executed.
</P>

<P>
In <I>conditional</I> message passing, the message remains queued until
some condition, specified by the receiver, becomes true.
At that time, the message is passed to the receiver, unblocking it.
</P>

<P>
A two-way flow of information, perhaps over the network, is called
an <I>extended rendezvous</I> and can be implemented with a pair
of sends and receives.
Typically a <I>client</I> thread uses this technique to communicate with
a <I>server</I> thread and request a service to be performed on its behalf.
A similar situation is a <I>worker</I> thread contacting a <I>master</I>
thread, asking for more work to do.
<P>

The base data types, <TT>int</TT>, <TT>double</TT>, etc.,

There are two types of threads in this collection of threads:
those that produce work and those that perform or consume the produced
work.
A producer puts the work to be done into a message passing channel
that is called a <I>bag of tasks</I>
because consumers reach into the bag to extract the next piece of work
to do.

Threads can use semaphores and monitors to handle mutual
exclusion and condition synchronization.
Suppose though the threads do not share memory but are in nodes
that have private memories and CPUs on a LAN
and suppose they still want to do condition
synchronization to coordinate access to some shared resource.
If all we have is message passing, can we implement some sort of
<I>distributed mutual exclusion</I> algorithm?
Suppose we also want to avoid a central server to avoid a bottleneck.

In the absence of shared memory, a collection of Java threads can use this
technique to implement mutual exclusion.
The threads send messages to all other threads, asking for permission
to enter their critical sections.
The threads are all in the same JVM, but we say memory is not shared
here because the threads do not share any variables, semaphores, or
monitors.

The quick sort algorithm can be parallelized for a shared memory
multiple CPU machine by dedicating each CPU to a worker thread
and using a message passing channel as a bag of tasks.
The <TT>main()</TT> method puts the whole array to be sorted into
the bag.
A worker extracts the task, chooses a pivot point, and partitions
the array.
Each of the two partitions is then put back into the bag
for one of the workers to perform.
Even though message passing is being used for a bag of tasks,
shared memory is still required because the array is being
sorted ``in place'' and the work requests being put into the bag
are array index pairs and not pieces of the array itself.

The <I>distributed dining philosophers</I> do not have a central
server they can query for fork availability.
Instead each philosopher has a servant who communicates with the
two neighboring servants to negotiate the use of the forks.
The servants pass <TT>needL</TT>, <TT>needR</TT>,
<TT>passL</TT>, and <TT>passR</TT> messages back and forth.
Each fork is always in the possession of some philosopher,
one of the two on either side of the fork.
When a philosopher finishes eating, it labels its two forks as dirty.
A hungry philosopher's servant is required to give up a dirty fork in its
possession, if asked for by its hungry neighbor's servant.
This prevents starvation.
Study carefully how conditional message passing is used.
Does it matter if synchronous were used instead?

An extended rendezvous is also called a <I>remote procedure call</I>
from a client to a server (or a worker to the master)
because it resembles
(and syntactic sugar can make it nearly identical to)
a call to a procedure on a remote machine that is executed there.
Typically the call represents a request for service, such as reading
a file that resides on the remote machine.
The server may handle the request in its main thread or the server may
spawn a new thread to handle the request while the server's main thread
handles additional requests for service from other clients.
The latter gives greater throughput and efficiency since a lengthy
request would otherwise delay the handling of requests from the
other clients.

An addressing mechanism is needed so the client can contact an appropriate
server.
In the local case (everything in the same JVM), an object can be used
as the place for the client and server to ``meet'' and establish a rendezvous.
The server calls a method in the object and blocks until the client
calls a method.
At this point in time, both methods return a newly created object that
the client and server subsequently use for the two-way flow of information.
This object contains a message passing channel shared by them.
In the remote case, the client uses the server's machine name
and a TCP/IP port number to address the server;
the server ''listens'' on the TCP/IP port.

An object created from this

is used for the addressing described above.
In the local case, one such object is used by both client and server.
In the remote case, a client creates such an object using the
server's machine name and port number in the object's constructor;
the server uses just the port number.

<P>
When the rendezvous occurs, and object constructed from this
<A HREF="lib/Synchronization/ExtendedRendezvous.java">class</A>

In the local case (within the same JVM),
the client and server share this object and
use it to transact (synchronous message passing of object references).
In the remote case (between JVMs that might be on different physical machines),
each gets its own object and the object contains a socket
to the other JVM (and machine).
Objects are serialized through the socket.
The case of sending raw data types
through a pipe (same JVM) or a socket (different JVMs) is not implemented
and is an exercise for the reader.

This is a local case example.
A command line option controls whether or not the server spawns off a new
thread to handle the request.
The clients and server all share a <TT>EstablishRendezvous</TT> object
for addressing.
Each time a client wants to rendezvous with the server,
it calls the <TT>clientToServer()</TT> method
to get an <TT>ExtendedRendezvous</TT> object
whose <TT>clientMakeRequestAwaitReply()</TT> method is used
to transact with the server.
The client passes a reference to a <TT>RendezvousRequestReply</TT>
object to the server.
The object contains the data and a method for the server to call.
The <TT>ExtendedRendezvous</TT> object is only used once by the client;
however, it could be reused for multiple <TT>clientMakeRequestAwaitReply()</TT>
calls as is done in the next example.

a reply indicating that its forks are available.
The server spawns a new thread for each philosopher to handle the

This program attempts to measure the amount of time it takes to
transact a rendezvous.
A client sends a message containing an array of length <I>N</I>
to the server.
The server adds one to each entry of the array and sends it back.
The client does this <I>M</I> times
and calculates the number of bytes sent per millisecond.
The program can be run in two ways.
The local run passes the message as a reference from the client to the
server within the same JVM.
The remote run serializes the message containing the array through
a socket over the network to the server running in a different JVM,
possibly on another physical machine.

Synchronous
conditional message passing corresponds to a conditional simple rendezvous,
that is, once the condition is met there is a one-way flow of
information in the form of a message object from the client to the server.
This
<A HREF="lib/Synchronization/ConditionalRendezvous.java">
<TT>class</TT></A> implements an extended <I>guarded</I> or <I>conditional</I>
rendezvous in which there is a two-way flow of information once a server finds
a client message meeting the condition.
This class is a combination of <TT>EstablishRendezvous</TT>
and <TT>ExtendedRendezvous</TT> with the condition added.
The client calls the <TT>clientTransactServer()</TT> method of
the <TT>ConditionalRendezvous</TT> object, while the server first
calls <TT>serverGetClient()</TT> to get a client meeting the condition
and then the server uses the <TT>Rendezvous</TT> object returned
to interact with the client (<TT>serverGetRequest()</TT> and
<TT>serverMakeReply()</TT>).
The condition class has been
<A HREF="lib/Synchronization/RendezvousCondition.java">enhanced</A>
with more information passed to the <TT>checkCondition()</TT>
method so the condition check can be based on information gathered about
all outstanding messages.

<P>
An example using a condition that depends only on the message passed and
not on other messages is the dining philosophers classical problem.
As an exercise, add code to prevent starvation.
As another exercise, implement the bounded buffer multiple producers and
consumers with a conditional rendezvous.
Then implement the starvation-free database readers and writers
with a conditional rendezvous.

Multiple calls by servers to the <TT>serverGetClient()</TT> method
can be outstanding, that is blocked, waiting for a client message
meeting the condition.
A server can call <TT>serverGetClient()</TT> and before completing the
rendezvous with that client, the server can call it again,
so a server can be handling several rendezvous with different clients
simultaneously.
This is illustrated with the following banking example.
If <TT>starvationFree</TT> is false, a large withdrawal
can sit in the queue, while later smaller withdrawals succeed.
In contrast, if <TT>starvationFree</TT> is true, then the
server (bank thread) accepts only deposits and no withdrawals
until the bank balance is large enough to accept the waiting large
withdrawal.
The <TT>-a</TT> option sets the requirement that all deposits are processed
before any withdrawals.
The condition checking now depends not only on the message passed but also
on the other messages in the queue.
The <TT>-B</TT> option adds additional banks, which is not realistic,

<A NAME="SURMI"><H2>Remote Method Invocation</H2>

<P>
Sun Microsystems has added a <I>remote method invocation</I>
capability to Java, the ability to make remote procedure calls.
The latter term we used above to describe an extended rendezvous
between two threads in different JVMs, perhaps on different
physical machines.
Sun's RMI allows a thread in one JVM to invoke (call) a method in
an object in another JVM that is perhaps on a different physical
machine.
A new thread is created in the other (remote) JVM to
execute the called method.
The following example shows how to use it.
The <TT>ComputeServer</TT> remote object implements a <TT>Compute</TT>
interface containing a <TT>compute()</TT> method
that a local <TT>Client</TT> can call, passing a <TT>Work</TT>
object whose <TT>doWork()</TT> method the server calls.
The client is using the remote server to have work performed on its
behalf (adding vectors).
Presumably the server is running on a computer architecture that
can perform the work more efficiently.
Parameters to the remote method and the method's return result, if any,
are passed from one JVM to the other using
object serialization over the network.
